## Features

- **Automatic Call Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of call transcripts
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically categorize calls into predefined categories
- **Action Item Extraction**: Identify and extract action items from calls
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search through past call summaries
- **Call History**: View, search, and manage your call history
- **Customizable Categories**: Define custom call categories with specific summarization prompts
- **Export Options**: Export summaries in various formats (TXT, JSON, CSV)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Opik Integration**: Comprehensive tracing of all LLM interactions for monitoring and debugging
- **Natural Language Query**: Chat with your call data using natural language
- **Persistent Storage**: All data is stored locally for privacy
- **Call History Management**: View and manage your call history with the ability to delete entries

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher (recommended)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- [Opik API key](https://www.comet.com/signup?utm_source=call-summarizer&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=github) (optional but recommended for tracing)
- (Optional) [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for Python version management
- (Recommended) [direnv](https://direnv.net/) for environment variable management

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/call-summarizer.git
   cd call-summarizer
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies with Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Copy the example environment file and update with your API keys:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

## Configuration

The application can be configured using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```ini
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional - Opik for LLM tracing
OPIK_API_KEY=your_opik_api_key_here

# Storage paths
VECTOR_STORE_PATH=./data/vector_store
DATA_DIR=./data
```

## Opik Integration

The application includes built-in support for Opik tracing, which provides:

- Detailed tracing of all LLM calls
- Performance metrics and token usage
- Debugging information for prompt engineering
- Conversation history and chain visualization

To enable Opik tracing:

1. Sign up for a free account at [Opik](https://www.comet.com/signup)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add it to your `.env` file
4. Restart the application

All LLM interactions will now be traced and visible in your Opik dashboard.

### Running the Application

1. Start the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501)

### Development

- Install development dependencies:
  ```bash
  poetry install --with dev
  ```

- Run tests:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest
  ```

- Format code:
  ```bash
  poetry run black .
  ```

- Lint code:
  ```bash
  poetry run flake8 .
  ```
