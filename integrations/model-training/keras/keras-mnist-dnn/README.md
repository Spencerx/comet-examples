# Keras integration with Comet.ml

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is an API designed for human beings, not machines. Keras follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear & actionable error messages. It also has extensive documentation and developer guides.

Instrument Keras with Comet to start managing experiments, create dataset versions and track hyperparameters for faster and easier reproducibility and collaboration.

## Documentation
